Because of the small size of this project, contributions are handled fairly casually. Pull requests of all shapes and sizes are encouraged and will be considered promptly!

If you're unsure where to start, check out the [issues page](https://github.com/nathantspencer/distract-overflow/issues) or contact me directly at ntspencer@mix.wvu.edu.
